* Audio Player Light is an indepently created application with few modifications to drop-in.
* `/*ADDED*/` notation has been used to indicate changes/additions to the drop-in application.
* Only the "Main" class (AudioPlayer.java in this case) requires alteration. Specifically, using the Pane, windowAppPane instead of Stage/Scene.

<h5>Resizing Border</h5>
